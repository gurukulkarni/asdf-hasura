# Install

Plugin:

```shell
asdf plugin add hasura-cli https://github.com/gurukulkarni/asdf-hasura.git
# OR
asdf plugin add hasura-cli
```

hasura-cli:

```shell
# Show all installable versions
asdf list-all hasura-cli

# Install specific version
asdf install hasura-cli latest

# Set a version globally (on your ~/.tool-versions file)
asdf global hasura-cli latest

# Now hasura-cli commands are available
hasura version
```

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for more instructions on how to
install & manage versions.

# Why
The hasura Cli installation is just one of the things that we need but is harder to automate. Hence the Plugin!
